                        <p>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try 
                            to create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.</p>
                        <p>While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about 
                            my journey with the world.</p>
                        <p class="bold">How I got started</p>
                        <p>I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was learning. 
                            After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short 
                            summaries of what I learned using my own words.</p>
                        <p>That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping 
                            others learn and stay motivated.</p>
